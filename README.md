- Important to note that am still rerwiting the code since it was from sometime back.

- So part of it like the reducers instead of using if statements am starting to use switch. And some other parts that I did in the old - style.

- Android will not work properly since am in the process of updating it so instead you can run the Ios.

##Instructions
1. cd into the project and first npm install
2. then run react-native run-ios
3. if you need a release run: react-native run-ios --variant=release
